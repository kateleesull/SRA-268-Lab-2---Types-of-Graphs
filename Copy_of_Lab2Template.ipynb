I decided to use a scatterplot because both data sets were numerical and discrete. While the correlation is expectedly positive (of course the winning teams would score more points than the losing teams), the strength of the positive correlation is definitely a factor of interest. It also demonstrates the variance between the number of points a team typically wins by. This graph shows that teams often win by a very slight margin, though there are still a few outliers who win by a significantly large number of points."

This is likely because the majority of mascots to begin with are a part of the \"Carnivora\" order.

There is no clear trend in the data, possibly because the sample of years we have access to is not large enough, however it still represents the notable peaks and valleys in the data substantially. For example, we can see much more significant variance in the data after 1994, whereas before then the number of overtime games throughout the years was very similar."
